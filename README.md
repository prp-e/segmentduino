# Arduino Hexadecimal Display Driver

I just write this project for fun :P. Actually, this is a simple project to drive a seven segment display and show decimal/hexadecimal digits on 
that. First, it was only working with common anode seven segment, but now, it also works with common cathode seven segment display.

## The Hardware you need 

1. Arduino (I used Uno R3) 
2. Common Anode Seven Segment
